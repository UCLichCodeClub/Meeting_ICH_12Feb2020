Slides prepared by Stefan Piatek - How to get help with software development from RITS

RITS = Research IT Services, at UCL. It provides expertise in creating software for academic research, and collaborates with researchers across UCL on projects requiring these skills.

In this talk, Stefan explained how staff at RITS can help researchers at ICH by providing training and drop-in sessions. RITS provides support to the ICH Code Club in the form of 1:1 code assistance after the Code sessions, and runs a session every once in a while.
